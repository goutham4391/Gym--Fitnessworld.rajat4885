										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p>
<p>The advantages of using the Body Solid Pro &#8211; Dual Adjustable Cable Column</p>
<p>Functional training has its origins in rehabilitation. Physical therapists developed exercises that mimicked what patients did at home or work in order to return to their lives or jobs after an injury or surgery. For strength exercises to effectively transfer to your everyday movements, several components of the training movement need to be similar to the actual performance movement. This includes coordination, types of muscular contractions (concentric, eccentric, isometric), speed of movement and range of motion. Properly applied, functional strength training may provide exercise variety and additional training benefits that more directly transfer improvements to real-life activities. Standard resistance training machines are of limited use for functional training because their fixed patterns rarely mimic natural movements, and they focus the effort on a single muscle group, rather than engaging the stabilizers and peripheral muscles. The Body-Solid Pro &#8211; Dual Adjustable Cable Column is extremely useful for functional training because it allows you to recruit all major muscle groups while moving in multiple planes. The Pro &#8211; Dual Adjustable Cable Column provide a smooth, continuous action which reduces the need for momentum to start repetitions and a constant tension on the muscle which makes peak-contraction possible at the top of each rep. This station is designed to help your people wishing to:</p>

<p><strong> WHY BUY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reasons for choosing Body-Solid</strong></p>
<p>Body-Solid fitness equipment features materials and component parts of only the highest quality and durability. <strong>Frames</strong> All Body-Solid frames feature continuous, four side welded construction instead of the typical 2-side welds that have become common in the industry. We use heavy-gauge 2&#8243;x2&#8243;, 2&#8243;x3&#8243; and 2&#8243;x4&#8243; 11-gauge, high tensile strength steel in our mainframes. <strong>DuraFirm<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Pads</strong> Our exclusive DuraFirm Pads are tear-resistant, extra-thick and ultra comfortable. We use the highest density foam in the industry for a lifetime of support without bottoming out. <strong>Finish</strong> An electrostatically applied powder coat finish protects all Body-Solid fitness equipment. This is the same process used on industrial machinery because of its durability. It resists cracking, chipping and corrosion and makes cleaning a breeze. <strong>Pulleys &amp; Cables</strong> Fiberglass reinforced nylon pulleys are precision-matched to our cable diameter and revolve on seated ball bearings that never need maintenance and provide a lifetime of friction-free performance. Body-Solid Home Gyms and Freeweight Equipment have been praised in leading consumer reporting magazines and fitness enthusiast publications around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle &amp; Fitness Magazine – Home Improvement</strong> &#8220;On a budget, we wanted to replicate many of the movements we&#8217;d normally do at the gym, which required dumbbells, an Olympic barbell set and an adjustable bench and rack.
