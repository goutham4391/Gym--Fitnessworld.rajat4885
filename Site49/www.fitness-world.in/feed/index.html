			<p>Fitness World – ranked among India&#8217;s leading fitness brands – has set up a brand-new gym at a prime location in Farrukhabad. The swanky and world-class gym is the first-of-its-kind in the area. The facility was inaugurated on 9th September 2022 by Dr. Dinesh Kapoor, Managing Director, Fitness World India.</p>
<p>The gym is owned by Mr. Keshav Gupta, a fitness enthusiast and entrepreneur who has worked in Europe. He returned to India to launch his own venture and to help other individuals pursue their fitness goals. Mr. Gupta has seen a lot of scope for growth in the vicinity and plans to expand his business in the area.</p>
<p>The gym is packed with a variety of strength series equipment, cardio equipment and functional trainers. With membership available at a reasonable cost, the equipment and facility can be used by locals to achieve their fitness goals.</p>
<p>The gym has already received a positive response, thanks to how well-equipped it is. Earlier, locals used to pursue their fitness goals with home equipment or travel long distances to access gyms. The facility also provides services in the form of group and personal training programs that help clients achieve peak physical fitness.</p>
<p>Dr. Dinesh Kapoor said, &#8220;We are proud to launch this Fitness World facility in collaboration with Mr. Keshav Gupta. He has a keen business sense along with a love for everything fitness – this combination will serve our brand and customers well. I wish him every success in this endeavour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Farrukhabad facility joins Fitness World’s ever-growing list of gyms in India. It expands Dr. Kapoor’s bullish vision of providing Indians with the right equipment and facility to stay fit and lead long, healthy lives. He believes that prevention is better than cure and that fitness equipment contribute to preventive health management, helping avoid expensive hospital stays and bills.</p>
<p>Fitness World has spent close to 30 years setting up more than 12,000 commercial gyms across the country. The fitness chain has the distinction of setting up the largest showroom for fitness equipment in India. This facility is located in Delhi/NCR with more than 800 equipment on display.</p>
<p>Fitness World is also the lead distributor for a series of global fitness brands such as Body Solid and Steelflex. Fitness World stores have a wide range of commercial gym equipment and home gym equipment to meet varying fitness requirements. The fitness brand also provides gym installation services to corporate companies, gyms, clubs and any entity that is looking to set up a fitness facility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Smith machine was introduced in 1950 by American fitness guru Jack Lalanne. There are a variety of exercises that you can perform using this powerful equipment. The Smith machine targets major muscle groups and is a great way to get back in shape. There are many types of Smith machines available in the market and all of them offer diverse functionality to pursue your fitness goals.</p>
<p>The main star of the smith machine is the barbell, which allows you to perform squats, bench presses, shrugs, tricep extensions, bicep curls and deadlifts. The barbell is placed between two steel rails – this allows the barbell to move in a vertical direction with support from the rails. Steel hooks are present at either side of the barbell, allowing users to safely secure it when fatigue sets in.</p>
<p>If you are looking for the ideal fitness equipments for home use, then the Smith machine is the right choice for you. Let’s look at why you should add a Smith machine to your home or commercial gym.</p>
<p><strong>1) It promotes safe lifting</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the hooks do a capable job of ensuring that the user performs safe lifts. Balance and stability issues have always been an issue with squats and lunges. Not anymore with smith machines. Since the barbell is secured to the sliding rail, you can either move it up or down and this prevents mishaps from happening.</p>
<p><strong>2) It improves posture and form</strong></p>
<p>With the barbell properly secured, you can focus on your posture and this will help you perform lifts flawlessly. This ensures you steer clear of injuries while strengthening your muscles and keeping your joints stable and strong.</p>
<p><strong>3) It can be easily used by beginners</strong></p>
<p>Smith machines offer exceptional stabilization and this allows you to perform exercises with ease &#8211; even if you haven&#8217;t squatted, rowed or lunged before!</p>
<p><strong>4) It helps to focus on specific muscle groups</strong></p>
<p>If you are targeting specific muscle groups, then the Smith machine is for you! Since it offers only a single angle of movement, you can pull, push or squat in that isolated plane. This helps to meet specific exercise targets.</p>
<p><strong>5) It ensures you lift more</strong></p>
<p>A Smith machine ensures that you don&#8217;t have to struggle for balance. This coupled with the proper posture you get from this machine will ensure you lift more with Smith machines that with free weight.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking for commercial fitness equipments or home fitness equipments, the Smith machine is a great addition to your daily routine. At Fitness World, we have an amazing collection of fitness equipment that can meet your health goals or that your clients. Visit us to explore our exciting range of Smith machines!</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>In the changing scenery of the post-pandemic era, most countries are enjoying a revival in the realm of public health. In India, social directives are following suit with employee wellness and general fitness levels being scrutinized more so in the wake of all that happened in the last 2 years.</p>
<p>And this revival could not have come at a better time for the country.</p>
<h2>Fitness to India’s Rescue</h2>
<p>Obesity increased from approximately 20% in 2015-16 to approximately 25% in 2019-21, as per National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) data. According to a study in The Lancet, an estimated 60% of the Indian population is unaware of their hypertension conditions. And diabetes has been increasing since the end of the 20th Century, with India home to the 2nd largest population of diabetics behind China.</p>
<p>All these unhealthy conditions are said to be at a higher incidence in urban areas than in rural areas due to growing processed food industry, improved food e-commerce and delivery, sedentary work modes, and eating habits. In India, urban society is self-aware of its need for improved health consciousness and physical activity. It goes without saying that staying fit is one of the main factors that will resist the tide of unhealthy conditions emerging in the population.</p>
<h2>The Rise of Fitness World</h2>
<p>For this purpose, the importance of gyms, fitness centres, and other spaces that allow citizens to exercise daily cannot be understated. Fitness World, a leading fitness equipment provider in the country, was founded in 1993 to target this market. Initially concerned with the manufacture.</p>
<p>of a certain type of slimming machine, the company expanded to manufacture a wide range of fitness equipment and gym accessories, from treadmills to ellipticals to leg press machines to water rowers. Over the years, the managing director, Dr. Dinesh Kapoor, made the decision to expand its scope from being simply a manufacturer, to a company that has its own brick-and-mortar establishments and showrooms scattered over the country’s entire breadth and width.</p>
<h2>Positive Reception for New Gym in Ghaziabad</h2>
<p>Fitness World recently opened a gym for the residents of an extensive group housing project called Savior Park in Sahibabad, Mohan Nagar, Ghaziabad. Containing more than 1,150 apartments and spread out over almost 4 hectares, the lack of well-stocked gyms in this locality made fitness either a home affair or an inconvenient commute away. The residents were sorely in need of access to technologically up-to-date fitness equipment.</p>
<p>The new gym will be one of the most progressive fitness facilities in the area, owning strength series equipment, treadmills, ellipticals, stationary cycles, and much more. They would also provide services in the form of both personal and group training programs that assist clients in the process to maintain peak physical condition.</p>
<h2>MD Gym is the First Stepping Stone to Improved Fitness</h2>
<p>Just as in Ghaziabad, Dr. Kapoor is looking forward to building a community of gyms in several parts of India, to encourage fitness. Having been the driving force behind Fitness World&#8217;s goals for the last 28 years, he is bullish about public health improving because of gyms being established more often.</p>
<p>He remarked on the changing face of Indian health and how the setup in Ghaziabad would be one of the first stepping stones to expanding the same throughout the country:</p>
<p>“Fast urban lifestyles have resulted in an increase in various health complications. I have always maintained that prevention is better than cure. In that way, fitness equipment is the main factor in preventive health management, pivotal in avoiding expensive hospital bills and other forms of curative therapy. Our Ghaziabad gym is only the first stepping stone. We hope to set up establishments like these to other localities within the urban landscape of India. As we move forward, we look to the future of fitness improving in the years to come.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fitness-world.in/contact/">Fitness World</a> continues to set up gyms around the country. Should housing colonies, homeowner associations, and other corporate societies have any need for fitness amenities, they can contact our consultants with the same.</p>

			<p>Monsoon inconveniently comes along just as you&#8217;ve set up a regular exercise routine.</p>
<p>Most of us don’t like running in the downpour; even fewer of us want to turn up at a fitness class soaked. The Indian monsoon keeps many of us from going to the gym on a regular basis. Some of us fear the seasonal illnesses that circulate in public places, but staying active during the season is critical.</p>
<p>We can’t let it get in the way of fitness, can we? Don&#8217;t let the three months of pelting rain undo all of your summer progress. Get your hands on our must-have residential fitness equipment and do the deed at home itself.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we discuss the workout equipment you can have at home and train yourself:</p>
<p><strong>Step-up Equipment </strong></p>
<p>All you need for a great cardio workout at home is a flight of stairs. If you don&#8217;t have access to stairs, you can use Fitness World&#8217;s <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/fitness-world-stepper">stepper</a></span>. March in place with vigor, or increase the intensity by doing the high knee run in place. It provides all of the advantages of a high-intensity workout routine while putting little strain on your joints. It improves overall fitness by helping you increase strength, decrease fat, and improve cardiovascular health. It also burns calories, making it an excellent way to stay within your ideal body weight range.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Treadmills</strong></p>
<p>The treadmill is one of the most popular cardio machines and can help you lose weight. Treadmills are simple to operate, and their settings can be tailored to your specific needs, whether you want to walk, run, or climb. During the monsoons and winters, many outdoor athletes prefer to rely on cardio machines to maintain performance levels.</p>
<p>A treadmill allows you to exercise safely while reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions. Not only will it help you tone your muscles faster, but it would also assist you to burn fat faster while strengthening your hamstrings, quadriceps, glutes, and ankles. The <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/venus-treadmill">Venus Treadmill</a></span> from Fitness World has 9 simple exercise routines, is foldable for storage, and is easy to use, making it ideal for both the gym and at home.</p>
<p><strong>Dumbbells</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/rubber-hex-dumbbells-pair">Dumbbells</a></span>, on the other hand, are ideal for taking bodyweight workouts to another level with weighted workouts, or simply to maintain gym dynamism with weight lifting ability. Dumbbells are excellent for strength training, particularly for loading the skeletal system to increase bone density. They also put the muscular system to the test in order to increase lean mass, metabolism, and, ultimately, function. Dumbbells require very little storage space and require very little maintenance. Keep them dust-free and in a designated location, and you&#8217;ll have the ideal workout gear for your strength workout.</p>
<p><strong>Barbells</strong></p>
<p>The barbell appears to be the simplest piece of equipment, but it is one of the most difficult to master: consisting of a <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/olympic-training-bar/">training bar</a></span> and weight plates. When you first start doing barbell exercises, your body will be almost entirely focused on form; you&#8217;ll be starting to learn how to use all of your muscles together to move an object efficiently. You&#8217;ll enhance your neuromuscular connection as you refine your technique.</p>
<p>Resistance training includes barbell exercises. Resistance training involves moving resistance, usually weights, with your muscles. Barbell exercises are not only used to build muscle, but they are also good for cardio. There are special cardio barbells that are designed to be ultra-lightweight with a small diameter and can be loaded with light weights; if you want to focus more on muscular endurance, cardio barbells allow you to repeat the same action. Resistance training can lower your chances of developing diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise Balls</strong></p>
<p>This refers to a Swiss ball, physioball, stability ball, and other terms for an exercise ball. <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/gym-ball-in-cm">Exercise balls</a></span> are great for variety because they allow for quick workouts in a small indoor space. Several core and strengthening exercises using exercise balls can keep you fit throughout the monsoon season. The size of exercise balls varies. The primary advantage of exercising with an exercise ball is that the body responds to the instability of the ball in order to maintain balance, resulting in increased activation of core muscles, which can result in improved back and spine health, core stability, posture, and muscle balance. Leg curls, plank, straight leg bridge, and push-ups are all exercises that can be done on a stable ball.</p>

			<p>Fitness is a vital component of everyone&#8217;s lifestyle, but it is especially important for teenagers. Their body is changing and adjusting to the world around them throughout the time, so challenging it physically can help them develop into leaner, stronger, and overall healthier individuals. While sitting at a desk all day at school, college, or for tuition is bad since it keeps youth sedentary, finding the time and energy to fit everything into your calendar can be challenging.</p>
<p>These are exciting, formative years filled with many firsts, such as going to the gym. Starting out in the world of fitness and gym life as a novice sets you on a positive fitness path. There are numerous advantages to beginning a consistent workout regimen when you are young, as it prepares you for a healthy lifestyle as you get older. It instills in young people patience, dedication, and the importance of committing to something in order to gain rewards.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we have outlined the best workouts for teens to help them become the healthiest and happiest versions of themselves:</p>
<p><strong>Dumbbell Lunges</strong></p>
<p>Teens will enjoy these lunges as a beginning to gym activities. Begin by standing tall with your body straight and two weights by your sides. Exercising with Fitness World&#8217;s Hex dumbbells is an excellent technique to strengthen and muscle your legs. Lunges are a unilateral exercise that can be used to correct muscular imbalances in your legs. They aid in sports performance and movement by increasing overall leg strength.</p>
<p><strong>Seated Dumbbell Press</strong></p>
<p>The seated dumbbell press, also known as the military press, is an excellent way to strengthen your shoulders. It is a foundational action that is used by both elite athletes and beginners. The anterior deltoids, lateral deltoids, upper trapezius, triceps, and serratus anterior are the key muscles engaged during the seated dumbbell press, which can be done in six different ways. It gives the appearance of larger shoulders and a slimmer waist.</p>
<p><strong>Seated Cable Rows</strong></p>
<p>The seated cable row is a form of a strength training exercise that works the back and upper arms and is a great workout for kids who want to improve their upper body strength. It can be part of a multi-gym and is done on a weighted horizontal cable machine with a bench and footplates. Fitness World&#8217;s <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/fitness-world-8-station-multi-gym/">multi gym equipment</a></span> is composed of high-strength steel tubes and is appropriate for any gym, as well as an <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product-category/home-equipments/rower-home-equipments/">air rower</a></span> that can be used at home or in the gym. The seated cable row is a pulling exercise that targets the back muscles in general, as well as the latissimus dorsi, or &#8220;lats,&#8221; in particular. Because the biceps and triceps are dynamic stabilizers for this exercise, it also strengthens the forearm and upper arm muscles. The hamstrings and gluteus maximus are two other stabilizing muscles that come into play.</p>
<p><strong>Dips</strong></p>
<p>Dips are an excellent strength-training exercise that targets the triceps, shoulders, chest, and core all in one motion. Not only that but no special equipment is required. Dips are an upper-body pressing exercise that primarily targets the triceps, but they also target the chest, shoulders, and even the back. Dips that support your entire body on parallel bars can be done at the gym, but you can also utilize a bench or chair.</p>
<p><strong>Cardio Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Cardio helps to burn calories, enhance blood flow, strengthen muscles, improve balance and coordination, and boost bone density. Many teenagers believe that cardio is uninteresting, but there are so many possibilities that they only need to select the cardio option that best suits them. Fitness World&#8217;s <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product-category/commercial-equipments/treadmill-commercial-equipments/">treadmills</a>, <a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product-category/commercial-equipments/bikes-commercial-equipments/">stationary cycles</a>, <a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product-category/commercial-equipments/ellipticals-cross-trainers/">elliptical or cross trainers</a></span>, and other cardio training machines can all be found at the gym. In fact, most sports qualify as cardio, and it&#8217;s only the aspect of competition that adds interest.</p>
<p>We hope that this post has given you some useful information regarding the finest teen workouts and how to go about doing them. <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/">Fitness World</a></span>, India&#8217;s favorite fitness brand, has put together high-quality and inexpensive gym and home gym equipment to help you get fit and healthy.

			<p>In the constant bustle of life, fitness is an often-ignored aspect. It is bullied out of our schedule by work, social life, and other hobbies. Forcing yourself out of the bed early in the morning to go to the gym is not the most enticing of thoughts, because we prefer to do things that are more convenient, within the walls of our home.</p>
<p>The pandemic then emerged as another reason why many individuals avoided going to the gym. Staying at home became the norm, and now, at the cusp of a new era, it still seems practical that, as long as we can afford it, we stop relying on an external source for fitness and bring it inside our homes. So, we here at <a href="https://www.fitness-world.in/contact/">Fitness World</a> have compiled a list of the five most affordable home gym products to carry out a fun work-out regime.</p>
<h2>FW Eazy Bike</h2>
<p>Cardiovascular exercise is vital from day to day as it improves heart health, blood circulation, weight loss, and gives you the stamina to undertake physical tasks whenever you have to. For this purpose, you might want to purchase stationary exercise bikes for home, as they are easy to use, making them a popular choice among laymen. If you want to buy an exercise bike online, you can choose from several bike categories that have slightly varying processes of functioning. The more challenging category are upright exercise bikes: the rider pedals while in an almost-standing position, thus working the lower body more intensely.</p>
<p>Fitness World’s <a href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/fitness-world-eazy-bike-for-home-and-gym">FW Eazy bike</a> is a user-friendly upright bike and can be used by any age group conveniently—our only caution would be to people who have problems in their lower-extremity joints, as the weight transfer can be suboptimal for them. Otherwise, the product provides a sufficient workout to all those who require a moderately challenging run. It comes with 8 magnetic resistance levels for the user and an LCD display that displays various statistics of a workout session. .</p>
<h2>Venus Treadmill</h2>
<p>As it is with the case for the upright bike, the home treadmill facilitates cardiovascular exercise that burns fat, aiding in favourable outcomes like weight loss. The <a href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/venus-treadmill">Venus Treadmill</a> is an affordable option that reaches a top speed of 14kph, and is easy to operate with start/stop and speed buttons placed on the handle bar. It also comes with 36 pre-set programmes along with 1 manual and 3 user manual programs. It also has 9 exercise programs for your health regimen. Keep a regular track of your activity via the statistics on its LED display—calories, time, distance, pulse, and speed. Designed with wheels for transportation and a foldable body for storage this treadmill exercise machine doesn’t need too much manual effort for owners and movers.</p>
<h2>Fitness World Salvino Elliptical</h2>
<p>Developing the body of your dreams from the comfort of your home isn’t a low probability outcome anymore with the <a href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/fitness-world-salvino-elliptical">Fitness World Salvino Elliptical</a>. The cross-trainer machine focuses on specific lower body muscles while in use—as you rise, the incline of the motion stresses the lower part of the body and on the fall the quads work best. This is an ideal option for home gyms when the user wants to shed extra pounds or increase stamina with little to no stress on the lower-extremity joints—given there is no impact on the tread inside the foot pedal! The product includes a big LCD window with display feedback, heart rate sensors in the middle handlebars, a floor leveller, and wheels for transportation.</p>
<h2>Multi-Purpose Exercise Bench</h2>
<p>How do you maximize the use of your free weights—dumbbells or barbells—at home? With a multi-purpose exercise bench that has an adjustable backpad so that the user can find the suitable posture from which to build muscle at different muscle groups of the body. This permits the complete upper body training for chest, abs, shoulder, and back. It is adjustable based on the incline, decline, or flat position, depending on the exercise you are doing. With the <a href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/multi-purpose-exercise-bench">Multi-Purpose Exercise Bench</a> one can do sit-ups, dumbbell curls, bench press, dips, shoulder presses, and other upper body exercises in the right form, and it helps in flexibility, improving, and strengthening muscles. This product is made from durable alloy steel and has thick foam padding for maximum comfort!</p>
<h2>Discover Home Gym</h2>
<p>Often, there are fitness enthusiasts who prefer constant muscle and strength training. While, in most cases, this requires several machines in order to target the many muscle groups, is there a multipurpose contraption that can target several muscle groups at one time? You bet. This <a href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/discover-home-gym">multi-gym station</a> targets the upper-body, core, and lower-body muscle group i.e. a full-body workout; users are able to perform the seated bench, high pull crunch, abdominal crunch, and leg extension in their regimen. This product also has the benefit of adjustable weight plates, also known as “selectorized equipment.” It does fall in a slightly higher price range, but with the full-body workout benefits and its more reasonable price in comparison to other multi-gy stations, it has excellent value for money.</p>
<p>Fitness World’s best home gym equipment will help you transition towards a healthy lifestyle within the comfort of your home. Contact our consultants to understand the nuances hidden in the specifications of each product; they will offer you recommendations within reasonable price ranges.</p>

			<p>Home exercise bikes are a type of fitness equipment that provides simple, cardiovascular exercises that work the lower and core muscles lightly. They facilitate conditioning in a concise way, and they can also provide endurance athletes with an efficient conduit through which to channel their efforts.</p>
<p>This type of gym equipment naturally avoids the pitfalls of real-life cycling, such as the required hand-eye coordination, balance, and road awareness. As a result, it&#8217;s an excellent choice for beginners.</p>
<p>In this section, we will go over the features and characteristics of the three different stationary bike categories, and offer an outstanding example from each category:</p>
<p>1) <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product-category/home-equipments/bikes-home-equipments/recumbent-bikes-bikes-home-equipments/"><strong>Recumbent Bikes</strong></a></span><strong>: </strong></p>
<p>Unlike other stationary bikes, these have a low center of gravity and the pedals are well in front of the rider&#8217;s core, allowing for more &#8220;recumbing&#8221; (or a comfortable horizontal position) and less stress on the lower extremities (ankles, knees, and back). It also has a cushioned backrest that supports the rider and provides more stability, resulting in a longer and easier workout.</p>
<p>Recumbent bikes are especially beneficial to the elderly and those who have a poor back, gluteal, knee, and ankle health. Depending on price, these products will include LCD monitors that display statistics such as &#8216;time spent,&#8217; &#8216;calories,&#8217; and &#8216;distance covered,&#8217; and from which you can adjust electromagnetic pedal resistance and select pre-set programs.</p>

		</figure>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Our <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product/cindy-recumbent-bike/">Cindy Recumbent Bike</a></span> has 12 pre-set programs including but not restricted to manual, interval, weight loss, target heart rate, fit  test, random, warm up, and warm down. It can take a user of up to 150 Kg and has 20 resistance levels. It has an LED screen of an area of 13 x 17 square inches that displays variables like Time, Calories, Distance, Speed, Watts, Power, Resistance Level, Profile, Fan, and MP3.</p>
<p>2) <a href="https://www.fitness-world.in/product-category/home-equipments/bikes-home-equipments/spin-bikes-bikes-home-equipments/"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Spin Bikes</span></strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>These stationary bikes are the most similar to standard bicycles. They provide all of the benefits of cycling without the hassle of navigating other cyclists, vehicles, bystanders, and obstacles. Spinning will give your leg and core muscles a moderate workout while also flexing and loosening your ankles, knees, and hips. A spin bike workout is gentler on your ankles and knees than an upright bike workout, but more so than a recumbent bike workout.</p>
<p>It is recommended that users use these in accordance with their ability to withstand joint stress. Spin bikes are appropriate for people of all ages and have the same features as recumbent bikes, such as adjustable electromagnetic resistance levels, LCD screens, pre-set programs, and displayed workout statistics.</p>

<p>This category of stationary bikes provides a slightly greater challenge than the previous two. They require the rider to pedal while standing. The pedals are designed to be more durable due to the increased stress placed on them, and they work your calves, quads, and hamstrings more intensely. Upright bikes are completely safe as long as the rider does not have any problems with their lower extremity joints and does not overdo the exercise.</p>
